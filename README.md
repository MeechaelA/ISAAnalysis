# ISA Analysis
This repository is meant to capture verification efforts related to the International Standard Atmosphere in https://github.com/MeechaelA/InternationalStandardAtmosphere/tree/main

It will become more formal overtime. This is held here as separate from the InternationalStandardAtmosphere currently while integration testing schemes are being planned.

# Description
This repo implements code for reading, parsing, and writing desired formatting of the ISA tables. Currently only the geometric table is parsed, although this will change as future work occurs.
Separate, is a plotting ability comparing InternationalStandardAtmosphere output to table values made available by ICAO, in their manual for the International Standard Atmosphere.

# Credits
Huge credit to [MeGaGiGaGon](https://github.com/MeGaGiGaGon) for implementing the ability to parse the cursed tables. This approach will be followed as InternationalStandardAtmosphere work progresses.
